# searching
Cerise and Simon Building a Fake Search Engine Foolgle

CHANGELOG:
-- Removed redundant code within HTML file and stlyised with CSS
-- Added scripts.js to file
-- Defered scripts.js within HTML
-- you should see changes on the commit history


BUGS
-- Javascript search code works, but it doesn't with the HTML file. We're not sure why it hates the HTML as much as it does
-- Something with the header is preventing the JS file running
-- Results are not printed onto search.html and they're not stylised within search-stlye.css as a result of the
above issue
